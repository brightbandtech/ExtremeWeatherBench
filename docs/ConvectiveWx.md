# Severe Convective Weather

Severe convective weather was initially defined separately for each type of convective hazard (tornado, hail, wind, etc). Due to the grid spacing of the current global models, our initial release will combine these into a single category of severe convective days. These days were chosen from our initial list broken out by category with the additional requirement that they had to be days that generated multiple hazards (e.g. tornadoes and hail).

Severe storm data is primarily focused on the US for the initial release. Not only is the US the climatological maximum of severe convective weather (especially tornadoes) but we have the largest public archive of storms available.  We would welcome case studies from additional locations. 

## Choosing case study dates
To decide on the dates, we used the following online archives.

* [List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_tornadoes_and_tornado_outbreaks)   
* [List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Storm_Prediction_Center_high_risk_days)   
* [Tornado outbreak \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak)   
* Non-US Data from  
  * [European Severe Weather Database](https://eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi) 


## Severe days overall (to be used for v1)

This is a combination tornado and hail and wind days. For v1, we do not have the high enough resolution data to differentiate between tornadoes and wind and hail so we will just look at high-end events that did all of them.
