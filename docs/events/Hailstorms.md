# Major hailstorms

We focus our data on the US, again lacking global data, though we do have a few high-profile cases identified from collaborators and literature.  If you have additional large-scale hail outbreaks to add, please let us know.

To be selected as a hail-outbreak, it must be a large-scale event. This means that it cannot have dropped only one giant hailstone or have only hit one city.  We did not impose a specific minimum square footage but used the SPC storm reports database (in the US) to ensure that the hail was large scale.

   * From wikipedia: “An unusually strong storm blanketed a large portion of the northeast Denver metro area in the late evening. Golf ball-sized stones damaged homes and vehicles, in an event comparable to the May 2017 hail storm. Due to the late hour the storm hit, much of the hail would not melt until the following day”
