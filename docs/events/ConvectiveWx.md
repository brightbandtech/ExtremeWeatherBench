# Severe Convective Weather

Severe convective weather was initially defined separately for each type of convective hazard (tornado, hail, wind, etc). Due to the grid spacing of the current global models, our initial release will combine these into a single category of severe convective days. These days were chosen from our initial list broken out by category with the additional requirement that they had to be days that generated multiple hazards (e.g. tornadoes and hail).

Severe storm data is primarily focused on the US for the initial release. Not only is the US the climatological maximum of severe convective weather (especially tornadoes) but we have the largest public archive of storms available.  We would welcome case studies from additional locations. 

## Choosing case study dates
To decide on the dates, we used the following online archives of storms.

US-based storms
* [List of North American tornadoes and tornado outbreaks \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_North_American_tornadoes_and_tornado_outbreaks)   
* [List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Storm_Prediction_Center_high_risk_days)   
* [Tornado outbreak Days \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tornado_outbreak)   
* [Billion dollar Disasters from NCEI](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/billions/events/US/1980-2024?disasters[]=all-disasters)   
* [List of costly or deadly hailstorms \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_costly_or_deadly_hailstorms) 
* [SPC Storm reports](https://www.spc.noaa.gov/climo/reports/today.html)
* [List of derecho events \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_derecho_events) 

Non-US data
  * [European Severe Weather Database](https://eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi) 
  * Some data in South America can be found in this paper:

## Severe Convective Weather categories

These categories are available in the initial release.
* [Overall severe days](OverallSevereDays.md) 
* [High-risk bust days](SevereBustDays.md)

The case studies for these are provided below and they will be incorporated into future EWB releases with additional metrics. The primary factor holding them back from the initial release is the coarse grid spacing of the global models and the small scale-of these events.

* [Derechos](Derechos.md)
* [Major wind events](WindEvents.md)
* [Tornado outbreaks](TornadoOutbreaks.md)
* [Tornado outbreaks associated with Tropical Cyclones](TCTornadoOutbreaks.md)
* [Hailstorms](Hailstorms.md)
