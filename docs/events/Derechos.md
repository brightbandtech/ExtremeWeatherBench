# Derechos

Many of these are cross-listed with outbreaks. If they don’t generate enough tornadoes to meet the outbreak criteria, they are not cross-listed but many derecho events do generate some number of tornadoes.

It formed over Ontario in the morning and raced eastward in New York State in the late afternoon and early evening, gathering strength as it moved across New York and southern New England. Isolated areas received gusts up to 75 mph (121 km/h), causing hundreds of thousands of people to have power outages, as well as tree and power line damage. Microbursts occurred in Root, Pittstown, and Johnsonville, New York, with estimated maximum wind speeds of 80, 90, and 100 mph (130, 140, and 160 km/h), respectively. An EF0 tornado touched down in Canajoharie, New York.

    * From Wikipedia: “A widespread thunderstorm wind event known as a squall line formed from a slowly progressing cold front, that was possibly associated with the remnants of Tropical Storm Cristobal. The squall line, later classified as a derecho, blasted the eastern Midwestern United States and Eastern Canada. A rare moderate risk of severe weather was issued for a large part of Michigan and parts of Ohio and Indiana; these regions had not had a moderate risk of severe weather since 2013\. With a 5% chance for a tornado 45% hatched chance for damaging winds and 15% chance for damaging hail. Roughly 300 reports of high winds or wind damage were received from Michigan to western New York leaving 700,000 people without power. The storm system produced 7 tornadoes in the Canadian province of Ontario.”

    * From wikipedia: “A derecho brought damaging winds to parts of the central U.S. Tuesday night. Near Jasper, Missouri, a semi truck was overturned on Interstate 49 early Tuesday evening because of damaging thunderstorm winds from this squall line. A 75 mph (121 km/h) wind gust was estimated in the area of the incident. Tulsa, Oklahoma, reported estimated wind gusts of 65–75 mph (105–121 km/h) when the squall line of thunderstorms impacted that area early Tuesday evening. A wind gust to 64 mph (103 km/h) was clocked at Springfield–Branson National Airport in southwestern Missouri early Tuesday evening. Some 70 miles (110 km) to the west in Joplin, Missouri, and its suburbs, there were reports of trees and power lines down. The storms also produced hail up to the size of tennis balls – 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) in diameter – near Marshall, Mustang, Ninnekah and Yukon, Oklahoma. This storm system produced more than 450 reports of severe weather in the 24 hours ending early Wednesday morning from Illinois, Missouri and southeastern Kansas to parts of Texas and Louisiana. Most of those reports were for wind damage, strong thunderstorm winds or large hail. The derecho traveled more than 500 miles (800 km) before moving off the coast of Texas and Louisiana into the Gulf of Mexico and produced winds up to 78 mph (126 km/h) with hail up to 3.75 inches (9.5 cm) in diameter and a few tornadoes including a short-lived EF2 tornado north of Hochatown, Oklahoma that tossed two barges over 100 yd (91 m), a home's roof deck was collapsed, and a single-wide manufactured home was destroyed, with its base frame twisted and tossed 100 yd (91 m) to the east. A second house suffered significant roof and structural damage after large gas tanks were tossed into it. A third house had roofing material removed. Numerous trees were snapped or uprooted.”  Source:  [List of derecho events \- Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_derecho_events)
