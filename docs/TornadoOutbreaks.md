# Tornado outbreaks

Note, we are focusing on outbreak days initially, because they are larger scale and more in line with what current global models can predict. As model resolution improves, we can add high-impact tornadoes that do not satisfy the outbreak criteria. Also, this is entirely centered on the US since that is where the vast majority of tornado outbreaks happen.

The outbreaks spawned by TCs are separated out into their own list.

An outbreak had to have at least 10 tornadoes to be selected.
