# High-risk bust days

High-risk bust days are defined as those days that SPC issued a high (or moderate risk) and the atmosphere did not cooperate.  SPC is really good at their job and identifying cases within our 2020-2024 window meant there is only one such case.  We provide this case and then provide dates identified by our colleagues at SPC for cases outside this window.
