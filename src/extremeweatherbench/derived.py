class DerivedVariable(ABC):
    """An abstract base class defining the interface for ExtremeWeatherBench
    derived variables.

    A DerivedVariable is any variable that requires extra computation than what
    is provided in analysis or forecast data. Some examples include the
    practically perfect hindcast, MLCAPE, IVT, or atmospheric river masks. In some
    cases, a variable is available in some models and not others, so an
    optional variable or variables may be provided as a mapping. This can be the
    derived variable itself or a component of the derived variable, such as
    specific humidity (which would be computed using relative humidity and air
    temperature).

    Attributes:
        name: The name that is used for applications of derived variables.
        required_variables: A list of variables that are required to build the
            variable.
        alternative_variables: A dictionary of required variable keys and the variables
            that can be used as alternatives if the required variable is not present.
        optional_variables: A list of variables that are optional to build the
            derived variable, i.e. will not fail if not present, but can be included
            to save on compute time.
        derive_variable: An abstract method that defines the computation to
            derive the variable.
        compute: A method that builds the derived variable from the input variables.
        Depending on the implementation, compute may or may not load the data into
        memory.

    Example:
        class TestVariable(DerivedVariable):
            required_variables = ["specific_humidity"]
            alternative_variables = {"specific_humidity":
            ["relative_humidity", "air_temperature"]}
            optional_variables = ["orography"]
