# Case studies for Extreme Weather Bench

We have collected data for high-impact weather across a variety of categories. The configuration files for each case study are available separately (see [Case study implementation details](CaseStudyYamlDetails.md)). Each category is described below and linked to the separate file that documents each case study in that category as well as the criteria used to choose case studies and any databases used to identify these cases. 

EWB is a community benchmark!  If you want to submit new categories or new case studies,  please make sure to add descriptions for any events you submit into these documents as well as  the information needed to download the data (see [Case study YAML details]( CaseStudyYamlDetails.md)).
