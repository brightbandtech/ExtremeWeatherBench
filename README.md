# Extreme Weather Bench

As AI weather models are growing in popularity, we need a standardized set of community driven tests that evaluate the models across a wide variety of high-impact hazards. Extreme Weather Bench (EWB) builds on the successful work of WeatherBench and introduces a set of high-impact weather events, spanning across multiple spatial and temporal scales and different parts of the weather spectrum. We provide data to use for testing, standard metrics for evaluation by forecasters worldwide for each of the phenomena, as well as impact-based metrics. EWB is a community system and will be adding additional phenomena, test cases and metrics in collaboration with the worldwide weather and forecast verification community.
